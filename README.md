# Customer-Segmentation-and-Category-Review-Analysis-for-Quantium
## Overview

This repository contains the analysis conducted to understand customer behavior within the chip category for Quantium and to evaluate the performance of recent trial store initiatives. The goal of this project was to provide data-driven insights and strategic recommendations to inform the upcoming category review process, ultimately aiming to enhance sales, customer satisfaction, and drive business growth.

The analysis is divided into two main tasks:

1.  **Customer Segmentation Analysis:** Identifying distinct customer segments based on their purchasing patterns, preferences for product types, brands, and pack sizes. This analysis aims to understand the key drivers of spending within these segments.
2.  **Trial Store Performance Evaluation:** Assessing the impact of recent changes implemented in select trial stores by comparing their performance (sales and customer numbers) against control stores over a defined period.

## Key Findings (Summary)

* The **Mainstream segment** represents the largest customer base and contributes the highest total revenue.
* The **Budget segment**, while not the largest, demonstrates the highest average spending per customer and purchase frequency, indicating strong engagement.
* **Premium customers** exhibit preferences for branded and potentially gourmet options but show lower overall purchase frequency.
* Trial store initiatives in **Store 77** showed a significant positive uplift in both sales and customer numbers.
* **Store 86** experienced a modest increase in sales, primarily driven by increased spending per customer.
* **Store 88** saw increased sales but a decrease in customer numbers, suggesting higher spending from existing customers.
* The effectiveness of the trial varied across stores, highlighting the importance of considering store-specific factors.
